# toolbox
A collection of random tools - really just stuff for me.  Huzzah if you get some use out of it too!

- AttribChange.ahk: MACE changer for Windows files
- builddb.py: Builds a SQLite3 DB of realistic-looking user data.  Requires `users.txt` in format `first.last`.
- Typer.ahk: Send keystrokes to most recently used application (<Alt>-<Tab>) when Paste isn't an option
